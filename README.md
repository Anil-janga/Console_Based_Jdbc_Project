# Console_Based_Jdbc_Project
I'm excited to share my recent project — a User Management System built using Core Java (JDBC + MySQL). It's a simple, menu-driven console application that allows users to:

🔐 Login and Authenticate
📝 Create New Accounts
🔍 View Account Details
✏️ Update Profile Info (Phone & Address)
❌ Delete Accounts

🧠 Technologies Used:
✅ Java
✅ JDBC
✅ MySQL Database
✅ SQL CRUD Operations
✅ Command-line Interface (CLI)

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

JDBC connectivity

SQL integration in Java

Resource management and exception handling

Modular thinking even in console apps
